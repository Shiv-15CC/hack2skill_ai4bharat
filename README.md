## 🌟 Overview

FutureForge AI is an AI-powered career growth platform that helps students and developers plan, improve, and track their professional journey. It combines career simulation, resume analysis, and adaptive study planning into one system that predicts future career paths, identifies skill gaps, and generates personalized roadmaps. By continuously adjusting based on user progress, workload, and goals, FutureForge AI turns career development into a data-driven, guided, and measurable process instead of guesswork.

### 🎯 Problem Statement

- Students lack clarity on which skills and actions actually improve their career outcomes.
- Existing tools for resumes, learning, and career guidance work separately and don’t give a complete growth picture.
- Many learners follow random study plans, leading to wasted effort and slow progress.
- Weak resumes and missing industry-aligned skills reduce internship and job opportunities.
- No system currently predicts realistic career paths while adapting to user progress and burnout risk.
